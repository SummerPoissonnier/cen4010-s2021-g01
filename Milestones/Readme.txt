Gopher is going to be a website where users can connect with other
people that have similar interests as them. Upon developing the GUI
Mockup for Gopher, we discussed some things that we may change about our
original idea. For one, we had mentioned giving users the ability to 
message each other; however, we took this feature out as it seems not
feasible for our knowledge range. The Homepage of the website will be
a thread with the topic of the day where all users can write to if they
so choose. Another change we made to the design was when the user gets
suggested connections, the connections will display the other user's
name and interests instead of their name, age, contact information, and 
bio. The user will have the choice to then view the connection's account
or click on 'already met'. We also decided to include a page that displays
the user's friend's list instead of a page showing already suggested
connections. Another change was when the user clicks on the interest we
decided not to include a follow up question asking for more detail.
